# Coding-Project-15

Introduction

In this project, I will create a Financial Portfolio Management System that allows users to track and analyze investments. The system will be structured using ES6 JavaScript modules, focusing on reusability, modularity, and maintainability. I'll separate the code into modules for managing assets, calculating portfolio statistics, and simulating transactions, making it easier to extend as the portfolio grows.

Business Case

Scenario: A financial management firm wants to build a web-based system for managing clients' investment portfolios. The system should allow users to track their assets, calculate portfolio statistics, and simulate transactions. By organizing functionality into modules, the firm aims to create a system that can be maintained and expanded as needed.

Requirements

The system will have three main modules:

Asset Module: Manages information about individual financial assets.
Portfolio Module: Tracks a user's portfolio and calculates key statistics.
Transaction Module: Simulates buying and selling of assets.
